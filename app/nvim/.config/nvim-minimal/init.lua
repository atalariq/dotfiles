-- INFO: introduction
-- this is a minimal neovim configuration written in lua. this is not meant to
-- be a distribution, but rather a template for you to build upon and/or a
-- reference for how to configure neovim using lua in the latest version.
--
-- TUTOR:
-- if you're completely new to neovim and/or vim, consider going through
-- `:Tutor` inside neovim to get a basic idea of how it works.
--     if you don't know what this means, type the following:
--       - <escape key>
--       - :
--       - Tutor
--       - <enter key>
--
-- LUA:
-- some level of familiarity with lua/programming languages are also expected.
-- if you're new to lua, consider going through the official reference:
--    https://www.lua.org/manual
-- or a more friendly tutorial like:
--    https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
-- you can also check out `:h lua-guide` inside neovim for a neovim-specific
-- lua guide.
--
-- DEPENDENCIES:
-- this configuration assumes you have the following tools installed on your
-- system:
--    `git` - for vim builtin package manager. (see `:h vim.pack`)
--    `unzip` - for mason, specifically for `clangd`, which the config installs by default
--    `ripgrep` - for fuzzy finding
--    clipboard tool: xclip/xsel/win32yank - for clipboard sharing between OS and neovim (see `h: clipboard-tool`)
--    a nerdfont (ensure the terminal running neovim is using it)
-- run `:checkhealth` inside neovim to see if your system is missing anything.
--
-- MINIMAL:
-- to say that something is 'minimal' you have to define what variable you're
-- minimizing. this configuration minimizes for lines of code and concepts.
-- to some, this configuration may have too many plugins. for example, using
-- mason.nvim to manage lsp servers will be an unnecessary dependency if the
-- user is already familiar with lsps and is comfortable managing them through
-- their OS package manager. but to someone that isn't familiar with lsp servers
-- this approach wouldn't cover everything needed to have the 'minimum' necessary
-- for lsp + completion + fuzzy finding. to some, fuzzy finding is also a bloated
-- dependency.
-- this configuration is only a starting point/reference. it is expected that
-- the user will change the configuration to suit their needs.

-- set <space> as the leader key
-- must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
